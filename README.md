# Nennyland-Bot
This is a project spanning Twitch, Discord, and a website that interact with each other to create a unique Twitch viewing experience.

## Twitch
This Twitch bot is the main interface of play. By comunicating with the bot, you may perform every action through the Twitch Bot.
Actions include:
  - Buying Gear
  - Viewing Inventory
  - Dueling Players
  - Questing with Players
  - Buying Land
  - Betting on Others' Duels

## Discord
The Discord bot is a bit less involved than the Twitch bot, as it only allows a user to view things, not change them.
Actions include:
  - Viewing Inventory and Equipment
  - Viewing Owned Land
  - Connect (Temp, allows for twitch and discord accounts to link)

## Nintenoble.com (No domain purchased yet) 
The website is a global viewing site that allows users to see the state of the Maps and owned land. It also allows for users to log
in and adjust their equipment and do basic actions. 
Actions include: 
  - Viewing Inventory and Equipment
  - Purchasing Items from the Store
  - Real-Time Map Updates
  - Affinity is Visible When Logged In
